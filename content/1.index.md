# Hi, I'm Sdu

I am a dedicated software engineer with a passion for technology and community engagement. As a co-host of [ZATechRadio](https://zatechradio.co.za), I facilitate discussions that resonate with the South African tech community, exploring topics that impact tech enthusiasts in their daily lives. Outside of my professional pursuits, Beyond my professional pursuits, I cherish family time and enjoy cooking as a hobby, particularly trying out various recipes and grilling techniques, and mixology.


## A Software Engineer
I specialize in TypeScript, Elixir, C#, with experience in Kotlin for Android development.
I excel in building robust applications and backend APIs, and I have strong skills in frontend development with Vue.js and backend frameworks like Phoenix, ASP.NET and various nodejs based frameworks. 

I am adept at architecting and deploying applications across platforms, including mobile application distribution. I am dedicated to enhancing developer workflows and code quality through best practices and applied experience. Currently, I am eager to further explore Elixir and advance my skills in native mobile development using Kotlin and Swift with Kotlin Multiplatform.
